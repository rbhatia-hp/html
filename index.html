                An <b><i>online game</i></b> is a video game that is either partially or primarily played through the
                Internet or
                any
                other computer network available. Online games are ubiquitous on modern gaming platforms, including PCs,
                consoles and mobile devices, and span many genres, including first-person shooters, strategy games, and
                massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG). In 2019, revenue in the online games segment
                reached $16.9 billion, with $4.2 billion generated by China and $3.5 billion in the United States. Since
                2010s, a common trend among online games has been operating them as games as a service, using
                monetization
                schemes such as loot boxes and battle passes as purchasable items atop freely-offered games. Unlike
                purchased retail games, online games have the problem of not being permanently playable, as they require
                special servers in order to function.

                The design of online games can range from simple text-based environments to the incorporation of complex
                graphics and virtual worlds. The existence of online components within a game can range from being minor
                features, such as an online leaderboard, to being part of core gameplay, such as directly playing
                against
                other players. Many online games create their own online communities, while other games, especially
                social
                games, integrate the players' existing real-life communities. Some online games can receive a massive
                influx
                of popularity due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing them.
